# lib<fancy_memory> documentation website

This repository is used to host the [Doxygen documentation website](https://BB-301.github.io/c-fancy-memory-docs) for the [c-fancy-memory](https://github.com/BB-301/c-fancy-memory) repository, which latter corresponds to a very simple, very experimental C library for tracking dynamically allocated memory during C application and library development.
